## General Info

I wanted to create a project that showcased some of my more advanced vanilla JavaScript skills I've learned as well as HTML and SCSS entirely from SCRATCH.

I did have some difficulties showcasing the different forms of media in this project as the API displays both images as well as videos, however, JS simplified what I would've anticipated as being a more complex program should I have just tried to make it work with CSS.

Overall, I'm proud of this project and how far I've come. This project marks the 6 month mark of my full-time coding journey.

## Technologies

Project was created using HTML5, SCSS, and Javascript.

The API I used can be found (here)[https://api.nasa.gov/].
